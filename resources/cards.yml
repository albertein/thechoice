    Welcome, subject #2304.
  
- type: text

    You have been randomly selected for an aptitude test of the highest
    importance. You will be tested for your capacity to code and to think
    logically. 

- type: text
  text: >
    As you very well know, the recent regulation code dictates that all human
    specimens be regularly checked for programming abilities, as a matter of
    survival.

    This test is not a test. Any failing human will be removed from the
    active society and sent to silicon mines immediately. Do not disappoint.

- type: code
  text: >
    If you have understood the instructions, type: answer 'yes'
  code: |
    _question = new SimpleQuestion {
      correct: [ 'yes' ]
      smartass: [ 'no' ]
    }

    answer = (x) ->
      _question.answer(x)

    _condition = ->
      _challenge {}
      _question.react()

    From now on, any answer you give us will be given in this form.

    Good. Now, onto your first challenge.

- type: text
  text: >
    Two doors: '@left', and '@right'. One of them leads to redemption.
    One to eternal damnation. Two guards, '@ted' and '@larry'.
    One of them always lies, the other always tells the truth.
    You can ask the guards two questions: 'isDoor' and 'isTrue'.

- type: text
  text: >
    For example, if you wanted to ask @ted if he thinks the door to
    the left leads to redemption, you could type '@ted.isDoor(@left)'.

- type: text
  text: >
    Of course, since you don't know who is lying, that would be futile.

- type: code
  text: >
    Now listen closely: I want you to write a program that evaluates
    to true if the right door is.. the right one, and false if the right
    door leads to damnation. Go on, try it!
  code: |
    class Guard
      constructor: (@lying) ->
      
      isDoor: (door) ->
        @isTrue door.life

      isTrue: (truth) ->
        if @lying
          !truth
        else
          truth

    class Door
      constructor: (@life) ->

    _condition = ->
      successes = 0

      for i in [0, 1]
        for j in [0, 1]
          context = {
            left:  new Door(i == 0)
            right: new Door(i == 1)
            ted:   new Guard(j == 0)
            larry: new Guard(j == 1)
          }
          response = _challenge context

          if context.right.life == response
            successes += 1

      _respond(successes, 4)

    Good work, soldier! Let's see if you're so smart with the next
    problem.
